= Understanding variant selection

Gradle's dependency management engine is known as _variant aware_.
In a traditional dependency management engine like Apache Mavenâ„¢, dependencies are bound to components published at GAV coordinates.
This means that the set of transitive dependencies for a component is solely determined by the GAV coordinates of this component.
It doesn't matter what _artifact_ is actually resolved, the set of dependencies is _always the same_.
In addition, selecting a different artifact for a component (for example, using the `jdk7` artifact) is cumbersome as it requires the use of _classifiers_.
One issue with this model is that it cannot guarantee global graph consistency because there are no common semantics associated with _classifiers_.
What this means is that there's nothing which prevents from having both the `jdk7` and `jdk8` versions of a single module on classpath, because the engine has no idea what semantics are associated with the classifier name.

Gradle, in addition to the concept of a _module_ published at GAV coordinates, introduces the concept of _variants_ of this module.
Variants correspond to the different "views" of a component that is published at the same GAV coordinates.
In the Gradle model, artifacts are attached to _variants_, not modules.
This means, in practice, that different _artifacts_ can have a different set of dependencies:

.The Gradle component model
image::component-model-gradle.png[]

This intermediate level, which associates artifacts and dependencies to variants instead of directly to the component, allows Gradle to model properly what each artifact is used for.

However, this raises the question about how variants are selected: how does Gradle know which variant to choose when there's more than one?
In practice, variants are selected thanks to the use of <<variant_aware_plugins.adoc#sec:abm_declaring_attributes,attributes>>, which provide semantics to the variants and help the engine in achieving a _consistent resolution result_.

For historical reasons, Gradle differentiates between two kind of components:

- local components, built from sources, for which <<#sec:abm_configuration_attributes, variants are mapped to outgoing configurations>>
- external components, published on repositories, in which case either the module was published with Gradle Module Metadata and variants are natively supported, or the module is using Ivy/Maven metadata and <<#sec:mapping-maven-ivy-to-variants,variants are derived from metadata>>.

In both cases, Gradle performs _variant aware selection_.

[[sec:abm_configuration_attributes]]
== Configuration and variant attributes

Local components expose variants as _outgoing configurations_, which are <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:resolvable-consumable-configs,consumable configurations>>.
When dependency resolution happens, the engine will select one variant of an outgoing component by selecting one of its _consumable configurations).

[NOTE]
====
There are 2 noticeable exception to this rule:

- whenever a producer does _not_ expose any consumable configuration
- whenever the consumer _explicitly selects a target configuration_

In this case, _variant aware resolution is bypassed_.
====

Attributes are used on both _resolvable configurations_ (also known as a _consumer_) and _consumable configurations_ (on the _producer_).
Adding attributes to other kinds of configurations doesn't have sense.

The role of the dependency resolution engine is to find a suitable _variant_ of a _producer_ given the constraints expressed by a _consumer_.

This is where attributes come into play: their role is to perform the selection of the right _variant_ of a component.

[NOTE]
.Variants vs configurations
====
For external components, the terminology is to use the word _variants_, not _configurations_. Configurations are a super-set of variants.

This means that an external component provide _variants_, which also have attributes.
However, sometimes the term _configuration_ may leak into the DSL for historical reasons, or because you use Ivy which also has this concept of _configuration_.

[[sec:variant-aware-matching]]
== Variant aware matching

Let's take the example of a `lib` library which exposes 2 variants: its API (via a variant named `exposedApi`) and its runtime (via a variant named `exposedRuntime`).

[NOTE]
.About producer variants
====
The variant _name_ is there mostly for debugging purposes and to get a nicer display in error messages.
The name, in particular, doesn't participate in the _id_ of a variant: only its attributes do.
That is to say that to search for a particular variant, one _must_ rely on its attributes, _not_ its name.

There are no restriction on the number of variants a component can expose.
Traditionally, a component would expose an API and an implementation, but we may, for example, want to expose the test fixtures of a component too.
It is also possible to expose _different APIs_ for different consumers (think about different environments, like Linux vs Windows).
====

A consumer needs to explain _what_ variant it needs and this is done by setting _attributes_ on the _consumer_.

Attributes consist of a _name_ and a _value_ pair.
For example, Gradle comes with a standard attribute named `org.gradle.usage` specifically to deal with the concept of selecting the right variant of a component based on the usage of the consumer (compile, runtime ...).
It is however possible to define an arbitrary number of attributes.
As a producer, we can express that a consumable configuration represents the API of a component by attaching the `(org.gradle.usage,JAVA_API)` attribute to the variant.
As a consumer, we can express that we need the API of the dependencies of a resolvable configuration by attaching the `(org.gradle.usage,JAVA_API)` attribute to it.
Doing this, Gradle has a way to _automatically select the appropriate variant_ by looking at the configuration attributes:

- the consumer wants `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_API`
- the producer, `lib` exposes 2 different variants. One with `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_API`, the other with `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_RUNTIME`.
- Gradle chooses the `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_API` variant of the producer because it _matches the consumer attributes_

In other words: attributes are used to perform the selection based on the values of the attributes.

A more elaborate example involves more than one attribute.
Typically, a Java Library project in Gradle will involve 4 different attributes, found both on the producer and consumer sides:

- `org.gradle.usage`, explaining if the variant is the API of a component, or its implementation
- `org.gradle.dependency.bundling`, which declares how the dependencies of the component are bundled (for example, if the artifact is a fat jar, then the bundling is `EMBEDDED`)
- `org.gradle.libraryelements`, which is used to explain what _parts_ of the library the variant contains (classes, resources or everything)
- `org.gradle.jvm.version`, which is used to explain what _minimal version_ of Java this variant is targeted at

Now imagine that our library comes in two different flavors:

- one for JDK 8
- one for JDK 9+

This is typically achieved, in Maven, by producing 2 different artifacts, a "main" artifact and a "classified" one.
However, in Maven a consumer cannot express the fact it needs the _most appropriate_ version of the library based on the runtime.

With Gradle, this is elegantly solved by having the producer declare 2 variants:

- one with `org.gradle.jvm.version=8`, for consumers _at least running on JDK 8_
- one with `org.gradle.jvm.version=9`, for consumers starting from JDK 9

Note that the artifacts for both variants will be different, but their dependencies _may_ be different too.
Typically, the JDK 8 variant may need a "backport" library of JDK 9+ to work, that only consumers running on JDK 8 should get.

On the consumer side, the _resolvable configuration_ will set all four attributes above, and, depending on the runtime, will set its `org.gradle.jvm.version` to 8 or more.

[NOTE]
.A note about compatibility of variants
====
What if the consumer sets `org.gradle.jvm.version` to 7?

Then resolution would _fail_ with an error message explaining that there's no matching variant of the producer.
This is because Gradle recognizes that the consumer wants a Java 7 compatible library, but the _minimal_ version of Java available on the producer is 8.
If, on the other hand, the consumer needs _11_, then Gradle knows both the _8_ and _9_ variant would work, but it will select _9_ because it's the highest compatible version.

[[sec:mapping-maven-ivy-to-variants]]
== Mapping from Maven/Ivy to variants

Neither Maven nor Ivy have the concept of _variants_, which are only natively supported by Gradle Module Metadata.
However, it doesn't prevent Gradle from working with them thanks to different strategies.

[NOTE]
.Relationship with Gradle Module Metadata
====
Gradle Module Metadata is a metadata format for modules published on Maven, Ivy or other kind of repositories.
It is similar to `pom.xml` or `ivy.xml` files, but this format is _aware of variants_.
This means that if your project produces additional variants, those are available and published as part of the module metadata, which greatly improves the user experience.

See the {metadata-file-spec}[Gradle Module Metadata specification] for more information.

[[sub:maven-mapping-to-variants]]
=== Mapping of POM files to variants

Modules published on a Maven repository are converted into variant-aware modules.
A particularity of Maven modules is that there is no way to know what kind of component is published.
In particular, there's no way to make the difference between a BOM representing a _platform_, and a BOM used as a super-POM..
Sometimes, it is even possible for a POM file to act both as a platform _and_ a library.

As a consequence, Maven modules are derived into 6 distinct variants, which allows Gradle users to explain precisely what they depend on:

* 2 "library" variants (attribute `org.gradle.category` = `library`)
** the `compile` variant maps the `<scope>compile</scope>` dependencies.
This variant is equivalent to the `apiElements` variant of the <<java_library_plugin.adoc#,Java Library plugin>>.
All dependencies of this scope are considered _API dependencies_.
** the `runtime` variant maps both the `<scope>compile</scope>` and `<scope>runtime</scope>` dependencies.
This variant is equivalent to the `runtimeElements` variant of the <<java_library_plugin.adoc#,Java Library plugin>>.
All dependencies of those scopes are considered _runtime dependencies_.
- in both cases, the `<dependencyManagement>` dependencies are _not converted to constraints_
* 4 "platform" variants derived from the `<dependencyManagement>` block (attribute `org.gradle.category` = `platform`):
** the `platform-compile` variant maps the  `<scope>compile</scope>` dependency management dependencies as _dependency constraints_.
** the `platform-runtime` variant maps both the `<scope>compile</scope>` and `<scope>runtime</scope>` dependency management dependencies as _dependency constraints_.
** the `enforced-platform-compile` is similar to `platform-compile` but all the constraints are _forced_
** the `enforced-platform-runtime` is similar to `platform-runtime` but all the constraints are _forced_

You can understand more about the use of platform and enforced platforms variants by looking at the <<controlling_transitive_dependencies#sub:bom_import, importing BOMs>> section of the manual.
By default, whenever you declare a dependency on a Maven module, Gradle is going to look for the `library` variants.
However, using the `platform` or `enforcedPlatform` keyword, Gradle is now looking for one of the "platform" variants, which allows you to import the constraints from the POM files, instead of the dependencies.

[[sub:ivy-mapping-to-variants]]
=== Mapping of Ivy files to variants

Contrary to <<#sub:maven-mapping-to-variants, Maven>>, there is no derivation strategy implemented for Ivy files.
This means that when you have a dependency on an Ivy module, Gradle does _not_ perform variant aware resolution.
Instead, it uses a legacy "compatibility" mode.
