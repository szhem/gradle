== What is dependency management?

Software projects rarely work in isolation. In most cases, a project relies on reusable functionality in the form of libraries or is broken up into individual components to compose a modularized system. Dependency management is a technique for declaring, resolving and using dependencies required by the project in an automated fashion.

== Dependency management in Gradle

Gradle has built-in support for dependency management and lives up to the task of fulfilling typical scenarios encountered in modern software projects.
We’ll explore the main concepts with the help of an example project.
The illustration below should give you an rough overview on all the moving parts.

The example project builds Java source code.
Some of the Java source files import classes from link:https://github.com/google/guava[Google Guava], a open-source library providing a wealth of utility functionality.
In addition to Guava, the project needs the link:http://junit.org/junit5/[JUnit] libraries for compiling and executing test code.

Guava and JUnit represent the _dependencies_ of this project.
A build script developer can <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#declaring-dependencies,declare dependencies>> for different scopes e.g. just for compilation of source code or for executing tests.
In Gradle, the <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:what-are-dependency-configurations,scope of a dependency>> is called a _configuration_.
For a full overview, see the reference material on <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:dependency-types,dependency types>>.

Often times dependencies come in the form of <<dependency_management_terminology.adoc#sub:terminology_module,modules>>.
You’ll need to tell Gradle where to find those modules so they can be consumed by the build.
The location for storing modules is called a _repository_.
By <<declaring_repositories.adoc#declaring-repositories,declaring repositories>> for a build, Gradle will know how to find and retrieve modules.
Repositories can come in different forms: as local directory or a remote repository.
The reference on <<declaring_repositories.adoc#sec:repository-types,repository types>> provides a broad coverage on this topic.

At runtime, Gradle will locate the declared dependencies if needed for operating a specific task.
The dependencies might need to be downloaded from a remote repository, retrieved from a local directory or requires another project to be built in a multi-project setting.
This process is called _dependency resolution_.
You can find a detailed discussion in <<dependency_resolution.adoc#sec:how-gradle-downloads-deps,How Gradle downloads dependencies>>.

Once resolved, the resolution mechanism <<dependency_resolution.adoc#sec:dependency_cache,stores the underlying files of a dependency in a local cache>>, also referred to as the _dependency cache_.
Future builds reuse the files stored in the cache to avoid unnecessary network calls.

Modules can provide additional metadata.
Metadata is the data that describes the module in more detail e.g. the coordinates for finding it in a repository, information about the project, or its authors.
As part of the metadata, a module can define that other modules are needed for it to work properly.
For example, the JUnit 5 platform module also requires the platform commons module.
Gradle automatically resolves those additional modules, so called _transitive dependencies_.
If needed, you can <<controlling_transitive_dependencies.adoc#,customize the behavior the handling of transitive dependencies>> to your project's requirements.

Projects with tens or hundreds of declared dependencies can easily suffer from dependency hell.
Gradle provides sufficient tooling to visualize, navigate and analyze the dependency graph of a project either with the help of a link:https://scans.gradle.com/get-started[build scan] or built-in tasks.

== Understanding difference between libraries and applications

[[sub:producers-vs-consumers]]
=== Producers vs consumers

A key concept in dependency management with Gradle is making the difference between consumers and producers.

When you _build_ a library, you are effectively on the _producer_ side: you are producing _artifacts_ which are going to be _consumed_ by someone else, the _consumer_.

A lot of problems with traditional build systems is that they don't make the difference between a producer and a consumer.

A _consumer_ needs to be understood in the large sense:

- a project that depends on another project is a _consumer_
- a _task_ that depends on an artifact is a finer grained consumer

In dependency management, a lot of the decisions we make depend on the type of project we are building, that is to say, <<#sub:being-respectful-consumers,what kind of _consumer_ we are>>.

[[sub:producer-variants]]
=== Producer variants

A producer may want to generate different artifacts for different kinds of consumers: for the same source code, different _binaries_ are produced.
Or, a project may produce artifacts which are for consumption by other projects (same repository) but not for external use.

A typical example in the Java world is the Guava library which is published in different versions: one for Java projects, and one for Android projects.

However, it's the consumer responsibility to tell what version to use, and it's the dependency management engine responsibility to ensure _consistency of the graph_ (for example making sure that you don't end up with both Java and Android versions of Guava on your classpath).

In Gradle, _producer variants_ are exposed via <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:resolvable-consumable-configs,consumable configurations>>.

[[sub:strong-encapsulation]]
=== Strong encapsulation

In order for a producer to compile a library, it needs all its _implementation dependencies_ on the compile classpath.
There are dependencies which are only required _as an implementation detail_ of the library and there are libraries which are effectively part of the API.

However, a library _depending_ on this produced library only needs to "see" the public API of your library and therefore the dependencies of this API.
It's a subset of the compile classpath of the producer: this is strong encapsulation of dependencies.

The consequence is that a dependency which is assigned to the `implementation` configuration of a library _does not end up on the compile classpath of the consumer_.
On the other hand, a dependency which is assigned to the `api` configuration of a library _would end up on the compile classpath of the consumer_.
At _runtime_, however, all dependencies are required.
Gradle makes the difference between different kinds of consumer even within a single project: the Java compile task, for example, is a different consumer than the Java exec task.

More details on the segregation of API and runtime dependencies in the Java world <<java_library_plugin.adoc#,can be found here>>.

[[sub:being-respectful-consumers]]
=== Being respectful of consumers

Whenever, as a developer, you decide to include a dependency, you must understand that there are _consequences for your consumers_.
For example, if you add a dependency to your project, it becomes a _transitive dependency_ of your consumers, and therefore may participate in conflict resolution if the consumer needs a different version.

A lot of the problems Gradle handles are about fixing the mismatch between the expectations of a consumer and a producer.

However, some projects are easier than others:

- if you are at the end of the consumption chain, that is to say you build an _application_, then there are effectively _no consumer_ of your project (apart from final customers): adding <<controlling_transitive_dependencies.adoc#excluding-transitive-deps,exclusions>> will have no other consequence than fixing your problem.
- however if you are a library, adding <<controlling_transitive_dependencies.adoc#excluding-transitive-deps,exclusions>> may prevent consumers from working properly, because they would exercise a path of the code that you don't

Always keep in mind that the solution you choose to fix a problem can "leak" to your consumers.
This documentation aims at guiding you to find the right solution to the right problem, and more importantly, make decisions which help the resolution engine to take the right decisions in case of conflicts.
