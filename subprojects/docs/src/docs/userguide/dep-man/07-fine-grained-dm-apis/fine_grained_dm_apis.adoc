== Setting default configuration dependencies

A configuration can be configured with default dependencies to be used if no dependencies are explicitly set for the configuration.
A primary use case of this functionality is for developing plugins that make use of versioned tools that the user might override.
By specifying default dependencies, the plugin can use a default version of the tool only if the user has not specified a particular version to use.

=== Changing configuration dependencies prior to resolution

At times, a plugin may want to modify the dependencies of a configuration before it is resolved.
The `withDependencies` method permits dependencies to be added, removed or modified programmatically.

=== Enabling Ivy dynamic resolve mode

Gradle's Ivy repository implementations support the equivalent to Ivy's dynamic resolve mode.
Normally, Gradle will use the `rev` attribute for each dependency definition included in an `ivy.xml` file.
In dynamic resolve mode, Gradle will instead prefer the `revConstraint` attribute over the `rev` attribute for a given dependency definition.
If the `revConstraint` attribute is not present, the `rev` attribute is used instead.

To enable dynamic resolve mode, you need to set the appropriate option on the repository definition.
A couple of examples are shown below.
Note that dynamic resolve mode is only available for Gradle's Ivy repositories.
It is not available for Maven repositories, or custom Ivy `DependencyResolver` implementations.
